#Task  # 1

#Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# Assignment operator =  This operator will check the assigned value of a variable.
# for ex: if x = 2 it will assign value 2 to the variable x.
# == operator Equality operator compares two values and check whether they are equal.
# for ex: if x == 2 it will check it is equal to 2.

# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# ** operator is exponential opearator. it is used to calculate the number to the power of another number
# for ex: if 2 * * 4 = 16

# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
# The ^ operator is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.
# It compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand.
# If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.
# Otherwise, it is set to 0.

x = 10  # Binary: 1010
y = 4   # Binary: 0100
result = x ^ y  # Binary result: 1110
print(result)  # Outputs 14

# Binary breakdown:
# 1010
# 0100
# ----
# 1110 (which is 14 in decimal)
